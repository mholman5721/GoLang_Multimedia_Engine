# golang-games
This Git repository contains examples utilizing my multi-media graphics engine made with SDL2 and GoLang.

Portions of this engine were based on heavily modifying code provided by [Jack Mott](https://github.com/jackmott/gameswithgo-public), which was presented in a series of [online tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDZujg-VgQlZUy1iCqBbe5faZLMkA3g2x).
