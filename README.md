# GoLang_Multimedia_Engine
This Git repository contains examples utilizing my multi-media graphics engine made with veandco's [go-sdl2](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2) SDL2 bindings for Google's Go programming language.

Portions of this engine were based on heavily modifying code provided by [Jack Mott](https://github.com/jackmott/gameswithgo-public), which was presented in a series of [online tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDZujg-VgQlZUy1iCqBbe5faZLMkA3g2x).
